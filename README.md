## Demo

Live Demo: [Smart Energy Calculator](https://your-demo-url.com)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for background animation
- [Google Fonts (Poppins)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-energy-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd smart-energy-calculator
```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server.

## Usage

1. Setting the Rate:
   - Enter the cost per unit in the rate input field
   - Click "Add Rate" to store the rate
   - The rate will be saved and displayed for future calculations

2. Calculating by Meter Reading:
   - Select the "Meter Reading" tab
   - Enter previous and current meter readings
   - Click "Calculate Bill" to see the result

3. Calculating by Direct Units:
   - Select the "Direct Units" tab
   - Enter the number of units consumed
   - Click "Calculate Bill" to see the result

4. Resetting Data:
   - Click the "Reset" button to clear all stored data
   - This will remove the saved rate and clear all input fields

## Features in Detail

### Rate Management
- Persistent storage of electricity rate
- Easy rate updates
- Clear display of current rate

### Calculation Methods
1. Meter Reading Method:
   - Calculates units consumed from meter readings
   - Validates input to ensure current reading > previous reading

2. Direct Units Method:
   - Simple calculation from known units
   - Quick results for pre-known consumption

### Energy Consumption Tips
- Dynamic tips based on consumption level
- Three categories:
  - Low consumption (< â‚¹500)
  - Moderate consumption (â‚¹500 - â‚¹1000)
  - High consumption (> â‚¹1000)

### User Interface
- Interactive particle background
- Glass morphism design
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clear visual feedback



## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Opera (latest)

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Modern web browser
